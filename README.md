# Git-Extras

The best way of learning Git is practicing it. While practicing, it is beneficial to monitor the index, the status,
the objects database and the working copy in some cases. A set of bash/groovy/ruby scripts are created to monitor
and analyze Git internals and collected in this repository.

## Prerequisites

The scrips in this repository are written in Bash, Groovy and Ruby and execute native Git commands. So in order to run
all the scripts, the following applications should already be installed on your machine.

* Git 1.7+
* Groovy 2+
* Ruby 2+

## Installation

Just clone this repository to a folder (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`) which is in the list of `PATH` environment variable.

NAME
      git-config-sample - Updates your git configuration with the ones we advice

SYNOPSIS
      git-config-sample

DESCRIPTION
      git-config-sample updates your git configuration with a set of config commands that we
      advice to use without fear. I also includes detailed explanation for each config entry.

USAGE
      You can directly call the script and let it update the configuration.

          git-config-sample

      In order to check whether the configurations are updated or not, you can check
      `~/.gitconfig` file.

DISCUSSIONS
      The content of this script is gathered after using Git for years with many tweaks.
      We also made a good search to learn how git-geeks use on their systems.

<a name="git-find-repos"/>

#### git-find-repos

```
NAME
      git-find-repos - Finds all existing git repositories

SYNOPSIS
      git-find-repos [-h | --help] [-d | --dirty] <path>

DESCRIPTION
      git-find-repos is a Bash script that searches .git folders recursively under the given folder
      path.

OPTIONS
      <path>
          Path of a folder to run the recursive search. If it is not provided, th directory that
          you are in is used for doing the search.
      -d, --dirty
          Checks the status of detected git repositories. Whenever it finds a repository having
          updates that hasn't been push to upstream (these are the updates not added yet, the
          updates added but not committed yet, and the updates committed but not pushed yet), it
          marks the repository as dirty. With this option, only the dirty repositories are printed,
          not all of them.
      -h, --help
          Prints usage information for help.

USAGE
      Typically you can search for all available git repositories. Do not provide the path if you
      want to search in your current directory.

          git-find-repos
          git-find-repos /path/to/search

      In order to run the search just the dirty repositories, use -d option.

          git-find-repos -d
          git-find-repos -d /path/to/search
          git-find-repos --dirty /path/to/search

DISCUSSIONS
      We clone git repositories to our machines. We use many different source directories to clone
      into. For instance, sometimes we clone repositories to our home folder, sometimes to our
      `/usr/local/` folder. From time to time we lose track of what we changed in these
      repositories. This script is mainly designed for searching git repositories having local
      modifications (i.e. -d option). It can also be used to list all git repositories in your
      machine to see the overall picture of what you cloned so far.

      It might be not possible to search git repositories in some directories due to missing access
      rights. On those directories, this script does not warn you.

<a name="git-generate-changes"/>

#### git-generate-changes

```
NAME
      git-generate-changes - Generates random file changes and commits to Git repository

SYNOPSIS
      git-generate-changes [-h | --help] [-g | --commit] [(-p | --prefix) <prefix>]
                           [(-c | --count) <number of files>] [(-e | --extension) <extension>]

DESCRIPTION
      git-generate-changes is a Bash script for creating bulk random commits in repository.

OPTIONS
      -g, --commit
          Commit all newly created files to the repository as one file per commit.
      -p, --prefix
          The prefix of the filename used in the new files. If not given, "temp" is used.
      -c, --count
          Number of files to create. If not given, count is set to 1.
      -e, --extension
          The extension of the filename used in new files. If not given, "txt" is used.
      -h, --help
          Prints usage information for help.

USAGE
      If no parameters are entered, the script creates 1 file with the default prefix and extension.
      The file is created in the root of the git repository. The number in filename is randomly
      selected between 1 and 100.

          $ git-generate-changes
          temp27.txt ... created

      You can define your own file name convention and decide to commit these files as one file
      per file.

          $ git-generate-changes -g -p catalina -e log -c 3
          catalina84.log ... created, committed
          catalina17.log ... created, committed
          catalina19.log ... created, committed

      If the random file name already exists in the same directory, the script updates it.

          $ git-generate-changes -g -p catalina -e log -c 3
          catalina63.log ... created, committed
          catalina17.log ... modified, committed
          catalina19.log ... modified, committed

DISCUSSIONS
      This script is mainly used when you need random commits while practicing Git. It speeds up
      your exercise if your aim is trying -for instance- merge or rebase, not commit.

```
NAME
      git-wtf - Displays the state of your repository in a readable, easy-to-scan format

SYNOPSIS
      git-wtf [branch+] [options]

DESCRIPTION
      git-wtf is a Ruby script. It displays the state of your repository in a readable, easy-to-scan
      format. It's useful for getting a summary of how a branch relates to a remote server, and for
      wrangling many topic branches.

OPTIONS
      -l, --long
          include author info and date for each commit
      -a, --all
          show all branches across all remote repos, not just those from origin
      -A, --all-commits
          show all commits, not just the first 5
      -s, --short
          don't show commits
      -k, --key
          show key
      -r, --relations
          show relation to features / integration branches
      --dump-config
          print out current configuration and exit

USAGE
      git-wtf uses some heuristics to determine which branches are integration branches, and which
      are feature branches. (Specifically, it assumes the integration branches are named "master",
      "next" and "edge".) If it guesses incorrectly, you will have to create a .git-wtfrc file.

      To start building a configuration file, run "git-wtf --dump-config > .git-wtfrc" and edit it.
      The config file is a YAML file that specifies the integration branches, any branches to
      ignore, and the max number of commits to display when --all-commits isn't used.  git-wtf will
      look for a .git-wtfrc file starting in the current directory, and recursively up to the root.

      IMPORTANT NOTE: all local branches referenced in .git-wtfrc must be prefixed with heads/, e.g.
      "heads/master". Remote branches must be of the form remotes/<remote>/<branch>.

NAME
      gitanalyzer - Analyzes the index and object database of git repositories

SYNOPSIS
      gitanalyzer

DESCRIPTION
      gitanalyzer is a Groovy script using native Git commands. It analyzes the index (staging area)
      and the object database (i.e. .git/objects directory) and produces a report.

      The script checks all the objects in object database, compares them with the entries in index
      and detects the obsolete ones. As a result, the script creates a report listing all the blobs,
      trees, commits and tags with a mark implying the unreferenced objects.

OPTIONS
      -d, --debug
          prints debug log information on the report

USAGE
      The script should be called in a git repository.

          gitanalyzer

      The report displays all objects including files, folders, commits and tags as a list. At the
      end a summary is displayed.

          *** INDEX vs OBJECT DATABASE:
          index count     : 117597
          object count    : 117597
          obsolete count  : 0

          *** OBJECT TYPES:
          commit          : 5315
          tree            : 89948
          blob            : 22308
          tag             : 26

          *** TIMINGS:
          execution time  : 1185894.095 ms (20 min)

DISCUSSIONS
      The initial aim of this script was to see the impact of garbage collection on objects. But
      then the report extended a little bit to prepare overall picture of the index and the object
      database.

      The script runs slow for big projects due to analysis per object. We plan to improve the
      performance in the coming releases.

NAME
      git-practice-platform - Creates a bare repo and multiple users for practicing git

SYNOPSIS
      git-practice-platform
          [-f | --folder <folder>]
          [-r | --repository <repository>]
          [-u | --usercount <count>]

DESCRIPTION
      git-practice-platform is a Bash script that creates a bare repository for simulating remote
      repositories, multiple clients cloning the bare repository simulating a teamwork on the
      repository.

OPTIONS
      -f | --folder <folder>
          The name of the root folder where all users clone the repository in it
      -r | --repository <repository>
          The name of the repository which is created for testing purposes
      -u | --usercount <count>
          Number of cloning users. If not defined, 2 users are created by default.
USAGE
      In order to create 3 users, the following command can be used.

          $ git-practice-platform -u 3 -f practicegit -r uberproject
          Root folder >>
              Created as /Users/user/practicegit
          Bare repository >>
              Created under server/uberproject.git
          User1 repository >>
              Created folder server/uberproject.git
              Cloned under clients/user1/uberproject.git
              Applied initial git configurations
              Created file .gitignore
          User2 repository >>
              Created folder server/uberproject.git
              Cloned under clients/user2/uberproject.git
              Applied initial git configurations

              Applied initial git configurations
              Created file .gitignore
          1 bare repository and 3 clients are created. Ready for practicing.

      And the following folder structure is created.

          practicegit/
          |-- clients
          |   |-- user1
          |   |   `-- uberproject.git
          |   |-- user2
          |   |   `-- uberproject.git
          |   `-- user3
          |       `-- uberproject.git
          `-- server
              `-- uberproject.git

DISCUSSIONS
      The best way of learning git is practicing it. We've been practicing git by creating bare
      and cloning repositories on our locals for a long time. This script automatises the whole
      create folders process and lets you initialize the practicing platform with one command.

NAME
      live-findfiles - Continuously displays the files with their paths as a list under the current
      folder

SYNOPSIS
      live-findfiles [<path>]

DESCRIPTION
      live-findfiles is a Bash script that runs find command on every second and displays the files
      with their paths (including hidden files and folders)

USAGE
      The script runs `find` command and displays the content as a list. By default, it displays
      content of the current directory.

          live-findfiles
          live-findfiles .

      It also displays the content of any given directory continuously.

          live-findfiles ~/data
          live-findfiles ../../items

DISCUSSIONS
      The script can be used to monitor the contents of folders and visualize the impact of git
      commands. We use it to monitor object warehouse (.git/objects folder) while using git
      commands (add, commit and gc).

NAME
      gitcatfile - Displays the raw content of a git object

SYNOPSIS
      gitcatfile [-e <path>]

DESCRIPTION
      gitanalyzer is a Groovy script. It inflates git objects and displays the raw content. The
      objects could be any files under `.git/objects/` directory.

OPTIONS
      -e, --extracts
          Extracts the object in the given path

USAGE
      A valid git object file should be passed to display the raw content.

          $ gitcatfile -e .git/objects/1e/8a2b3dcc1092004df16fd151334a963815f4d5
          tree 38\0
          100644 readme.txt\0 aba8d507fce75a7b9e7b98f800618695c483608b

DISCUSSIONS
      Normally we can also view the content of each object by using `git cat-file -p` command.
      However it formats the output and does not let you see the raw content. This script
      inflates the file via ZLib inflator and parses the content byte by byte. Then converts it
      into human-friendly form.

      The following the the output of git cat-file command.

      $ git cat-file -p 1e8a2b
      100644 blob aba8d507fce75a7b9e7b98f800618695c483608b	readme.txt

      And the following is the output for the same object by our script.

      $ gitcatfile -e .git/objects/1e/8a2b3dcc1092004df16fd151334a963815f4d5
      tree 38\0
      100644 readme.txt\0 aba8d507fce75a7b9e7b98f800618695c483608b

      We see null character as "\0" and 20 byte SHA-1 of referencing objects as hex string. New
      lines are added between entries to visualize better.
